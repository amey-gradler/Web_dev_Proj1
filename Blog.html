            <h3>1.Dhoni and Kohli Practicing For WI Tour</h3>
            <img class="blogimage" src="download.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="blogtext">India's batting in Test cricket revolves around
                Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara. They
                have
                been the pillars
                of the line-up for almost a decade now and the number three batsman gives an insight, while speaking to
                Harsha Bhogle in Cricbuzz in Conversation, as to what makes them click as a pair.

                There cannot be two different batsmen than Kohli and Pujara. They are like chalk and cheese. One likes
                to
                dominate the opposition while the other grinds them out but both are necessary for a team's cause. The
                duo
                have accumulated 2894 runs together with seven hundred and 14 fifty-plus partnerships and average 47.44
                in
                62 innings.

                Pujara gives a glimpse into what it's like to bat with Kohli, "As soon as he comes he will ask what are
                they
                (the opposition) trying to do, how the ball is swinging. If it's a left-arm seamer, what are the angles
                he
                is using, whether he's trying to bowl an inswinger or an away swinger. There's a lot of communication."

                The duo were earmarked as the future Dravid and Tendulkar of Indian cricket when they started off and
                though
                they have carved their own path, when it comes to batting together the traits are very similar to that
                of
                their predecessors. The opposition generally used to target Tendulkar as he was the bigger scalp and
                Dravid
                used to fly under the radar, it is a similar case with Kohli and Pujara.</p>

            <h3>2.England: Three quicks or four? It's all down to Stokes' fitness</h3>
            <img class="blogimage" src="Capture.PNG" alt="">
            <p class="blogtext">Joe Root confirmed that England have yet to decide on the balance of their side for the
                first Test against Pakistan, which begins on Wednesday (August 5), and will only do so once they have a
                clearer idea of whether Ben Stokes will be fit enough to bowl.

                The-all rounder tweaked a quad muscle in the second Test against the West Indies last month and played
                in
                the deciding match as a batsman only. Stokes bowled two overs in the middle and then in the nets to Zak
                Crawley during training at Emirates Old Trafford on Monday (August 3) without any issues but wet weather
                in
                Manchester on Tuesday meant he was unable to bowl outside. As a result, England have not yet been able
                to
                adequately assess his fitness.

                "Luckily, we're in a position where we can name the same squads in the same squad of 14 as the last
                game,
                but we still need to know a little bit more about where Ben's at," Root said. "Unfortunately because of
                the
                weather today he wasn't able to bowl outside. So we will wait on that throughout the night and make a
                decision in the morning. With that squad of players, we've got a number of different options, we've got
                everything to cover the conditions and the pitch, and whatever that throws at us, we feel like we'll
                have an
                answer for it.".</p>

            <h3>3.Cricket Australia postpone T20I series against West Indies</h3>
            <img class="blogimage" src="Capture2.PNG" alt="">
            <p class="blogtext">Cricket Australia has indefinitely postponed the proposed three-match T20I series
                against
                West Indies scheduled for the first week of October. The decision was communicated on Tuesday morning
                following discussions between the two boards.

                The three-match series, with games at Townsville, Cairns and the Gold Coast on October 4, 6 and 9
                respectively, was to serve as a tune-up before the T20 World Cup. But with the ICC rescheduling that
                marquee
                event to 2021 because of the Coronavirus pandemic, there was little to gain from a three-match series
                which
                brings with it significant logistic overheads.

                The cancellation of the West Indies T20Is delays the international debut of the Bill Pippen Oval in Gold
                Coast. The Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns too will have to wait a while before getting to host an
                international
                game. It last played host to a Australia vs Sri Lanka Test, 16 years ago.

                Incidentally, India have been pencilled in to play three T20Is - October 11, 14 and 17 - as well, an
                assignment that is now unlikely to go ahead following BCCI's reworked IPL schedule in the
                September-November
                window. It is highly likely that the T20Is against India might be accommodated following the Test and
                ODI
                leg of their visit in December-January."Luckily, we're in a position where we can name the same squads
                in the same squad of 14 as the last
                game,
                but we still need to know a little bit more about where Ben's at," Root said. "Unfortunately because of
                the
                weather today he wasn't able to bowl outside. So we will wait on that throughout the night and make a
